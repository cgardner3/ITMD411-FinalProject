# ITMD411-FinalProject
Write a program that creates two database tables one that holds all of the trouble tickets and another that holds the user credentials. 

Two other files are used one to create a login window for the user to input their username and password and another to use the menu options for an admin or user. 

There is another file used to connect to the SQL server and for CRUD operations. The operations should include being able to insert tickets, update records, delete records, view the records, and close a ticket using a ticket number.
